notebook implements a simple Multi-Agent Customer Support Assistant designed for enterprise workflows.\n","It uses three lightweight agents—an Intent Agent, a Reply Agent, and an Escalation Agent—coordinated by a central Orchestrator.\n","Together, they classify the user’s message, generate a professional reply, and decide whether escalation is required.\n","The system demonstrates clean multi-agent orchestration suitable for enterprise automation tasks such as ticket handling, customer assistance, and workflow optimization."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"dd7d8167","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00265,"end_time":"2026-01-19T13:33:46.880429","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-01-19T13:33:46.877779","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
