notebook implements a simple Multi-Agent Customer Support Assistant designed for enterprise workflows.\n","It uses three lightweight agents—an Intent Agent, a Reply Agent, and an Escalation Agent—coordinated by a central Orchestrator.\n","Together, they classify the user’s message, generate a professional reply, and decide whether escalation is required.\n","The system demonstrates clean multi-agent orchestration suitable for enterprise automation tasks such as ticket handling, customer assistance, and workflow optimization."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"342a5622","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002496,"end_time":"2026-01-19T13:43:23.678753","exception":false,"start_time":"2026-01-19T13:43:23.676257","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
